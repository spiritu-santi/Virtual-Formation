# Virtual Formation: a list of fossil calibration for dating.

This repository includes several lists of fossils used for calibration of phylogenetic trees. The fossils listed have been vetted for accesibility of original publication and for sufficient information. 
The lists includes fossils used in published dating analyses:
- Gymnosperm Member: fossil gymnospermns used for calibration of the tree in [Olson et al.]() (under review) Stem water transport as shaped by leaf size across the world’s woody plants.
- Angiosperm Member: fossil angiopsmers used for calibration of the tree in [Ramírez-Barahona et al.]() (2020) The delayed and geographically heterogeneous diversification of flowering plant families. Nature Ecology and Evolution 4.
- Fern Member: fossil ferns used for calibration of the tree in [Nitta et al.](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science/articles/10.3389/fpls.2022.909768/full) (2021) An open and continuously updated fern tree of life. Frontiers in Plant Sciences 13.
  - TreeFern Bed: fossil tree ferns use for calibration of the tree in [Ramírez-Barahona](https://doi.org/10.1093/evolut/qpae034) (2021) Incorporating fossils into the joint inference of phylogeny and biogeography of the tree fern order Cyatheales. Evolution 78.
- Salamander Member: fossil salamanders use for calibration of the tree in [Ramírez-Barahona et al.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s42523-023-00271-7) (2023) Host phylogeny and environment shape the diversity of salamander skin bacterial communities. Animal Microbiome 5.
