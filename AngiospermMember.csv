The age of Zone C-VII is bracketed by late Aptian marine fossils in overlying units (Doyle et al., 1977, 1990). Doyle et al. (1977, 1982) dated Zone C-VII as early Aptian, but Doyle et al. (1990) and Doyle (1992) suggested it may be late Barremian, based on the occurrence of other taxa that appear in Zone C-VII, correlative rocks in Brazil, and better-dated Barremian rocks elsewhere, notably Afropollis and the first reticulate tricolpates (Doyle et al., 1982; Gübeli et al., 1984; Penny, 1989; Regali and Viana, 1989; Doyle, 1992). Additional evidence that favors a pre-Aptian age is the absence in Zone C-VII of two groups that appear in the overlying Zones C-VIII and C-IX and the Aptian of Egypt, namely striate tricolpates, which are not known until the Albian in Southern Laurasia but occur earlier in Northern Gondwana (Penny, 1988a; Hochuli et al., 2006; Heimhofer et al., 2007; Heimhofer and Hochuli, 2010), and the non-columellar reticulate monosulcate genus Pennipollis (“Retimonocolpites” peroreticulatus, etc.), which appears just above the base of the marine Aptian of England and has never been reported from well-dated pre-Aptian rocks (Penny, 1988b; Doyle, 1992; Hughes, 1994; Hochuli et al., 2006).

This “core Laurales” clade was well supported in previous studies (Soltis et al., 1999, 2000a, 2000b, 2007, 2011; Qiu et al., 1999, 2000, 2005, 2006, 2010; Renner, 1999, 2004; Doyle and Endress, 2000; Savolainen et al., 2000; Zanis et al., 2002, 2003; Nickrent et al., 2002; Hilu et al., 2003). Relationships within the clade based on the morphological analysis were not identical to those found in molecular or combined morphological and molecular analyses (Doyle and Endress, 2000), but they are consistent in supporting the monophyly of the Hernandiaceae-Lauraceae-Monimiaceae clade (though with the addition of Siparunaceae) and the position of Atherospermataceae and Gomortegaceae as outgroups to this clade (though as two successive branches rather than a clade).

These beds contain a palynoflora assigned to the lower part of Zone III of the Potomac sequence, which Doyle and Robbins (1977) dated as early Cenomanian. The age of Zone III is bracketed above by the appearance of triporate Normapolles pollen (Complexiopollis spp.) in the lower Raritan Formation of New Jersey (Zone IV) and the upper part of the Peruc Formation of Bohemia (Pacltová, 1971; Doyle and Robbins, 1977), and by late Cenomanian ammonites in the lower Raritan (Cobban and Kennedy, 1990). The Peruc Formation underlies marine sediments with late Cenomanian mollusks, and its upper part was correlated palynologically by Pacltová (1977) with late middle Cenomanian marine beds that contain the first Normapolles in England and France (Azéma et al., 1972; Laing, 1975); this agrees with studies of sequence stratigraphy in the Bohemian section by Ulicný et al. (1997). The probable latest Albian age of Potomac Subzone II-C is discussed under Virginanthus. Because these data imply that the Zone III-IV boundary may lie within the middle Cenomanian, and the length of time between the base and top of Zone III is uncertain, it appears safest to conclude that Mauldinia could be of either early or middle Cenomanian age. Therefore, we propose the middle-late Cenomanian boundary, 95.5 Ma (no uncertainty provided; Ogg and Hinnov, 2012), as a conservative minimum age for Mauldinia.""",Massoni et al (2015),crown,core Laurales,5 / phylogenetic analysis,5 / combined morphological and molecular analysis (total evidence or backbone),"Massoni et al 2015 (PE): ""Because of identical features in the first formed wood of Paraphyllanthoxylon marylandense (Herendeen, 1991) and inflorescence axes of Mauldinia mirabilis (Drinnan et al., 1990), Doyle and Endress (2010) combined these two taxa in their analyses. Their molecular scaffold analysis, which used a backbone tree in which Lauraceae and Hernandiaceae formed a clade sister to Monimiaceae, placed this fossil in a single most parsimonious position, as the sister group of Lauraceae + Hernandiaceae. The three taxa were united by the following unequivocal synapomorphies: solitary vessels, inflorescences with lateral cymes, whorled tepals, whorled stamens, and one carpel. The basal position of Mauldinia relative to the two living taxa was supported by the absence of well-developed paratracheal parenchyma in the wood, the superior position of the ovary, and the presence of endosperm in the seed, while Lauraceae and Hernandiaceae are united by paratracheal parenchyma, an inferior ovary (reversed within Lauraceae: Rohwer and Rudolph, 2005), and lack of endosperm in the mature seed. A position sister to Lauraceae alone was four steps less parsimonious. However, as discussed for Cohongarootonia (Fossil 7), Lauraceae and Hernandiaceae are included together with Monimiaceae in a well-supported clade, but different analyses have found all possible relationships among the three families. When Doyle and Endress (2010) used a molecular backbone in which Monimiaceae were sister to Lauraceae, the single most parsimonious position of Mauldinia was sister to the whole clade of Hernandiaceae + Lauraceae + Monimiaceae. Doyle and Endress (2010) did not test the third alternative present in the literature (Lauraceae sister to the remaining two families), but using their data set we find that the most parsimonious position for Mauldinia under this arrangement is also sister to the three living taxa. Until this conflict is resolved, we consider Mauldinia mirabilis to provide a minimum age for the stem node of the clade of Lauraceae, Hernandiaceae, and Monimiaceae, in other words the crown node of the clade of Laurales excluding Calycanthaceae (Figure 1).""","crown core Laurales, min 95.5 Ma",95.5 Ma,†Mauldinia mirabilis Drinnan et al.,"Massoni J, Doyle J, Sauquet H. 2015.

(1994) comes from the Potomac Group at the Puddledock locality in the Tarmac Lone Star Industries sand and gravel pit 9 km southwest of Hopewell, Prince George County, Virginia, USA. Friis et al. (1994, 1995) and von Balthazar et al. (2011) considered this locality early or middle Albian, based on palynological correlation by R.A. Christopher (in Dischinger, 1987) with the basal part of Potomac Subzone II-B of Brenner (1963) and Doyle and Robbins (1977) and the suggestion of Doyle (1992) that Subzone II-B may begin in the early Albian. However, an early Albian age for Subzone II-B (and II-A) now appears unlikely in light of palynological correlations by Hochuli et al. (2006) with the well-dated marine Lower Cretaceous of Portugal and earlier work of Kemp (1970) on the marine Albian of England (cf. Doyle et al., 2008). These studies support correlation of upper Zone I with the basal early Albian of Portugal and the early Albian of England, based on the appearance in all these intervals of reticulate tricolpate pollen and Clavatipollenites rotundus (aff. Retimonocolpites dividuus of Doyle and Robbins, 1977), as argued by Doyle and Robbins (1977), but not striate tricolpates, which appear later in the early Albian of Portugal (Hochuli et al., 2006). Consistent with this, the Zone II index spore species Apiculatisporis babsae of Brenner (1963) appears at the base of the middle Albian in England (Kemp, 1970). The conclusion of Doyle (1992) that the Zone I/II boundary lies well down in the Aptian was based largely on comparisons with Pennipollis (Brenneripollis) species and Schrankipollis in Africa that appear to have involved too indirect correlations and incompletely controlled species ranges, as argued by Hochuli et al. (2006).
Clarke et al. (2011) proposed a much younger minimum age for Puddledock, 92.7 Ma, or the top of the Cenomanian, based on the suggestion of Hochuli et al. (2006) that Zone II extends into the Cenomanian and the presence of late Cenomanian ammonites in the next younger unit, the Raritan Formation of New Jersey (Cobban and Kennedy, 1990). Hochuli et al. (2006) argued convincingly that there is a significant break between Zones I and II in the Potomac sequence, since the early to middle Albian interval in Portugal shows continuing higher diversity of angiosperm monosulcates than tricolpates, whereas tricolpates are already more diverse at the base of Zone II. They argued that Subzone II-B is late rather than middle Albian, based on the higher diversity of tricolpates than in the Portuguese middle Albian and the presence through Subzone II-B of the smooth tricolpate species Cupuliferoidaepollenites (Tricolpopollenites) parvulus, which they noted has not been reported in dated sequences until the late Albian. However, the reliability of C. parvulus is uncertain, since this species is rare in Subzone II-B and easy to overlook (for example, it was not reported by Brenner, 1963). Furthermore, its first occurrences cited by Hochuli et al. (2006) are in Canada, in the Northern Laurasia province of Brenner (1976), where angiosperms were less abundant than in Southern Laurasia, and in deep sea cores. It is also possible that the higher diversity of angiosperms observed in the Potomac is partly a facies effect of comparing continental and marginal marine sequences. If angiosperms were locally dominant in some lowland habitats but subordinate to ferns and gymnosperms at the regional scale (cf. Pierce, 1961; Doyle and Hickey, 1976), more angiosperms (including rare species) might be detected in a fluvial sequence such as the Potomac Group than in marine deposits like those in Portugal, where they would be diluted by the higher regional production of fern spores and gymnosperm pollen. It is also likely that the contrast between diversity curves from the two sequences is exaggerated by the fact that the Portuguese curves were based on number of species per sample, whereas the Potomac curves were based on a range chart (Doyle and Robbins, 1977), so that species whose ranges pass through the horizon of a given sample but were not found in that sample were treated as present.
More positive evidence that much of Subzone II-B is middle Albian comes from palynological correlations with well-dated sequences in the US Gulf Coast and Western Interior, which were not considered by Hochuli et al. (2006). Doyle (1977) showed that the diverse angiosperm flora in the middle of Subzone II-B is especially similar at the species level to that described by Hedlund and Norris (1968) in the “Walnut” Clay and Antlers Sand (Fredericksburgian) of Oklahoma, which lies below the middle-late Albian boundary defined by ammonites in the overlying Goodland Limestone (Hedlund and Norris, 1968; Mancini and Puckett, 2005). Doyle and Robbins (1977) dated Subzone II-C as latest Albian, but Hochuli et al. (2006) argued that it is Cenomanian, based on the psilate tricolporate species Tricolporoidites ( Tricolporopollenites) distinctus and Tricolporoidites ( Tricolporopollenites) triangulus, which they stated first appear in the Cenomanian. However, most of the studies that Hochuli et al. (2006) cited considered only Cenomanian beds, not the latest Albian. More important, Ludvigson et al. (2010) listed psilate tricolporates (as Psilatricolporites sp.) in the latest Albian (Palynostratigraphic Unit 2) of the Dakota Formation (see discussion of Archaeanthus, Fossil 3), and Laing (1975) recorded triangular grains similar to T. triangulus as Psilatricolpites rectilatibus in the marine upper Albian of France (Laing distinguished P. rectilatibus from T. triangulus on lack of pores, but the bent shape of the colpi in the Cenomanian grain illustrated in his plate 90, figures 11-12 suggests that rudimentary pores were present). Together, these correlations lead us to consider that Virginianthus is of middle Albian age. Therefore, we use the middle-late Albian boundary, 107.7 Ma (no uncertainty provided; Ogg and Hinnov, 2012), as a minimum age for Virginianthus.""",Massoni et al (2015),crown,Laurales,5 / phylogenetic analysis,5 / combined morphological and molecular analysis (total evidence or backbone),"Friis et al. (1994) assigned Virginianthus calycanthoides to the stem lineage of Calycanthaceae because it resembles extant Calycanthaceae (including Idiospermum) but is more plesiomorphic in characters such as monosulcate rather than disulculate pollen. This assignment was questioned by Crepet et al. (2005) based on a combined (total evidence) analysis of a data set of Renner (1999), which included 15 morphological characters, sequences of six molecular markers, 25 taxa of Laurales, and three outgroups. This analysis identified Virginianthus as the sister group of either Laurales as a whole or all Laurales other than Calycanthaceae. A molecular scaffold analysis by Doyle et al. (2008), incorporating 65 morphological characters and using the same backbone trees as Doyle and Endress (2010), found two alternative most parsimonious positions for this fossil, one sister to Calycanthaceae, the other sister to the clade formed by all remaining Laurales. The first position was supported by extended anther connective and the second by embedded pollen sacs. Positions sister to Laurales as a whole and nested within Calycanthaceae were one step less parsimonious. Here we follow the result of Doyle et al. (2008) because it is based on a data set that included far more characters than Crepet et al. (2005), many derived from in-depth analyses of gynoecial morphology (e.g., Igersheim and Endress, 1997).

Building on the palynological zonation of the Potomac Group by Brenner (1963), to which Doyle (1969a) added Zone III (uppermost Potomac) and Zone IV (lower Raritan), Sirkin (1974) assigned South Amboy palynofloras to a new Zone V. This unit was renamed the Complexiopollis exigua - Santalacites minor Zone by Christopher (1979) and redefined by Christopher et al. (1999) as the lowest of three subzones of the Sohlipollis Taxon Range Zone. Wolfe and Pakiser (1971) and Sirkin (1974) considered the South Amboy late Cenomanian, not much younger than underlying Woodbridge Clay Member (Zone IV), but Doyle (1969b) and Doyle and Robbins (1977) argued that it is no older than middle Turonian, based on the presence of Normapolles genera that appear at that level in Europe (Góczán et al., 1967). Doyle and Robbins (1977) and Christopher (1979) allowed that it was “possibly Coniacian,” but Crepet and Nixon (1994) and Crepet et al. (2005) accepted a late Turonian age. By contrast, Clarke et al. (2011) suggested a minimum age of the Santonian-Campanian boundary, 82.8 Ma. However, correlations by Christopher et al. (1999) and Christopher and Prowell (2010) with better-dated rocks in South Carolina imply that the Crossman locality is not this young; they correlate the C. exigua - S. minor Zone with calcareous nannofossil zones CC13 and CC14, which extend from late Turonian through Coniacian (Burnett, 1998; Ogg and Hinnov, 2012). We therefore believe there is enough evidence to consider that Jerseyanthus was at least of Coniacian age, which translates into a conservative minimum age of 85.8 Ma, the Coniacian-Santonian boundary (86.3 ±0.5 Ma; Ogg and Hinnov, 2012).""",Massoni et al (2015),crown,Calycanthoideae,5 / phylogenetic analysis,5 / combined morphological and molecular analysis (total evidence or backbone),"Massoni et al 2015 (PE): ""Using the combined morphological and molecular data set described for Virginianthus (Fossil 4), in which Calycanthaceae were represented by Idiospermum, Chimonanthus, and Calycanthus, Crepet et al.

Potomacanthus lobatus, together with other material described previously from the Puddledock locality (Crane et al., 1994), shows that variation in the form of the androecium was also a feature of early members of the lauraceous clade. Both tetrasporangiate and bisporangiate stamens, as well as androecia with and without staminal appendages were already present by the end of the Early Cretaceous. Among extant taxa where androecial structure can be considered along with vegetative and other features, its androecial variation is useful systematically. The reconstructions of androecial characters states among extant representatives show that ancestral androecia are composed of three whorls and possess staminodes. It is of interest that Potomacanthus differs from all other extant or fossil Lauraceae in the details of the androecium. It most likely represents a separate and now extinct taxon within the family Lauraceae or on the stem lineage to the extant group (von Balthazar et al., 2007).

Mohr and Bernardes-de-Oliveira (2004) assumed that the Crato Formation is late Aptian or early Albian in age, based on numerous previous estimates (e.g., Pons et al., 1996). Because of this uncertainty, Clarke et al. (2011) proposed a minimum age for the Crato of 98.7 Ma, the top of the Albian. However, evidence has been accumulating in favor of a late Aptian age (Coimbra et al., 2002). Most recently, using gymnosperm pollen and dinoflagellates to correlate with better-dated sections, Heimhofer and Hochuli (2010) concluded that the Aptian-Albian boundary lies above the Crato Formation, and this was accepted by Mohr et al.

These relationships were supported by one unequivocal synapomorphy, the presence of glands on the stamens or staminodes (Doyle and Endress, 2010). A more recent molecular scaffold analysis (Mohr et al., 2013), which used a modified version of the morphological data set of Doyle and Endress (2010) reduced to Magnoliales, Laurales, and Canellales (as outgroup), placed Endressinia as the sister group of Schenkeriphyllum glanduliferum (another fossil from the same deposit, discussed below), with the clade of the two fossils being the sister group of Magnoliaceae. Endressinia and Schenkeriphyllum were united by sessile leaf blade (a new character) and linked with Magnoliaceae by sheathing leaf base and dry fruit wall. As noted by Mohr et al. (2013), Doyle and Endress (2010) did not score Endressinia as having a sheathing leaf base. This was probably because the sheath was formed from the unusual sessile leaf blade, rather than a leaf base separated from the blade by a petiole, but this difference does not rule out homology of the character. We have not attempted to resolve this conflict with a new analysis. The implications for dating are complicated by the fact that the position of Magnoliaceae within Magnoliales is still debated. Two alternative positions have been supported by most analyses: either as the sister group of a clade of Degeneriaceae + Himantandraceae (Soltis et al., 1999, 2007; Qiu et al., 2000, 2005, 2006; Savolainen et al., 2000; Zanis et al., 2002, 2003), or sister to a clade of Degeneriaceae + Himantandraceae + Eupomatiaceae + Annonaceae (Doyle and Endress, 2000; Sauquet et al., 2003). However, the results of both Doyle and Endress (2010) and Mohr et al. (2013) support a position of Endressinia within the crown group of Magnoliineae, the well-supported clade of five families that is sister to Myristicaceae (Sauquet et al., 2003), and each study alone leads to use of this fossil to calibrate the crown node of this clade.

This formation lies between the underlying Kiowa Shale of Albian age and the overlying Graneros Shale (Retallack and Dilcher, 2012) of Cenomanian age. It has been traditionally divided into two members, the Terra Cotta Clay Member below and the Jansen Clay Member above (Plummer and Romary, 1942). The beds containing the specimens considered here were assigned to the Jansen Clay Member (Dilcher and Crane, 1984). Dilcher and Crane (1984) considered the age of this locality to be latest Albian to earliest Cenomanian. However, D.L. Dilcher (pers. comm. in Doyle and Endress, 2010) argued that it is more likely latest Albian, based on a carbon isotope and sequence stratigraphic study by Gröcke et al. (2006) at the Rose Creek locality in Nebraska, where a flora described by Upchurch and Dilcher (1990) lies just below the Albian-Cenomanian boundary, plus the fact that the Dakota is transgressive toward the east and sites such as Russell County are among its most western exposures. A latest Albian age was accepted by Doyle and Endress (2010) and reaffirmed without discussion by Romanov and Dilcher (2013). However, although the Rose Creek and Linnenberger Ranch floras were both assigned to the Jansen Clay Member and considered roughly coeval by Farley and Dilcher (1986), their equivalence needs reexamination in light of detailed sequence stratigraphic and palynological analyses of the Dakota Formation in Kansas, Nebraska, and Iowa by Ludvigson et al. (2010). This study showed that the Dakota does not represent a simple transgressive sequence but rather three transgressive-regressive cycles. The first two cycles (equivalent to Palynostratigraphic Units 1 and 2) are late Albian, while the third (Units 3 and 4) is early and middle Cenomanian; the boundary recognized by Gröcke et al. (2006), between the second and third cycles, falls within beds formerly assigned to the Jansen Clay Member. Unfortunately, this analysis did not extend as far west as Russell County, although in Lincoln County, just to the east, the lower part of the third cycle is represented by Dakota continental beds that interfinger with marine rocks to the west. Because we cannot exclude the possibility that the Linnenberger flora is from the lower part of the third cycle, which Ludvigson et al. (2010) dated as early Cenomanian, we propose a conservative minimum age of 96.5 Ma for Archaeanthus, the early-middle Cenomanian boundary (no uncertainty provided; Ogg and Hinnov 2012).""",Massoni et al (2015),stem,Magnoliaceae,5 / phylogenetic analysis,5 / combined morphological and molecular analysis (total evidence or backbone),"Massoni et al 2015 (PE): ""The position of Archaeanthus linnenbergeri was investigated by Doyle and Endress (2010), in a molecular scaffold analysis in which the family Magnoliaceae (ca. 227 species) was split into two taxa: Magnolioideae, often treated by recent authors as the single genus Magnolia, and Liriodendron. This analysis placed Archaeanthus in three different most parsimonious positions: one as the sister group of Magnoliaceae as a whole, and two within crown-group Magnoliaceae, either sister to Liriodendron or sister to Magnolioideae. The clade of Archaeanthus and Magnoliaceae was supported by three unambiguous synapomorphies: sheathing leaf base, bilobed stipules, and elongate receptacle, while the positions within the family were supported by bilobed leaf apex (shared with Liriodendron) or dehiscent fruit (shared with Magnolioideae). By contrast, a recent cladistic analysis by Romanov and Dilcher (2013) positioned Archaeanthus sister to the Late Cretaceous seed genus Liriodendroidea (Frumin and Friis, 1996) and identified the clade made up of these two extinct genera as the sister group of Liriodendron, supported by four synapomorphies. This would imply that Archaeanthus provides a minimum age for crown-group Magnoliaceae. However, the taxonomic sampling of this analysis was very limited, as the extant taxa included only Magnoliaceae s.s. (= Magnolioideae) as a supra-specific terminal, Liriodendron, and Illicium (Austrobaileyales), which is many nodes more distant from Magnoliaceae than are other members of the order Magnoliales. In addition, one of the four proposed synapomorphies of Archaeanthus and Liriodendron, whorled perianth phyllotaxis, vs. spiral in Illicium and Magnolia, appears to be a symplesiomorphy in Magnoliales, where the perianth is basically whorled and trimerous (Endress and Doyle, 2009). Furthermore, although the perianth is spiral in some species of Magnolia s.l., in many species it is whorled (e.g., M. denudata : Erbar and Leins, 1981). Two other proposed synapomorphies, bilobed leaf apex and leaf lobation, are not independent characters, since the only lobation in the leaf of Archaeanthus is that of the apex; its origin requires only one change, not two. The status of the fourth synapomorphy, fruitlets shed from the receptacle, is uncertain, since Degeneria and most Annonaceae also have this feature (van Setten and Koek-Noorman, 1992). These observations imply that there are no more acceptable synapomorphies of Archaeanthus and Liriodendron in the Romanov and Dilcher (2013) data set than in Doyle and Endress (2010).
Even though we cannot dismiss the possibility that future analyses, based on denser taxon sampling and better knowledge of the phylogenetic position of Magnoliaceae, may eventually support a position of Archaeanthus within crown-group Magnoliaceae, we prefer to be conservative and recommend the use of Archaeanthus to serve as a minimum age constraint for the stem node of Magnoliaceae. In the current consensus tree presented in Figure 1, this is the same node as crown-group Magnoliinae (the larger clade of five families found by Doyle and Endress, 2010; Sauquet et al., 2003). However, this is not the case in one of the resolved trees of Massoni et al. (2014) on which this consensus tree is based, in which Magnoliaceae are the sister group of the clade consisting of Degeneria (Degeneriaceae) and Galbulimima (Himantandraceae). Furthermore, maintaining a distinction between the two nodes may be useful because the association of Archaeanthus with Magnoliaceae appears to be more strongly supported than that of Endressinia (and Schenkeriphyllum) and less likely to change in future analyses.""","stem Magnoliaceae (Magnoliales), min 96.5 Ma",96.5 Ma,†Archaeanthus linnenbergeri Dilcher & Crane,"Massoni J, Doyle J, Sauquet H. 2015.

The Princeton Chert consists of a series of alternating layers of coal and chert. The paleontological record supports a middle Eocene age, such as an amiid fish correlated with the occurrence of comparable fossils in British Columbia and in the Klondike Mountain Formation of Washington State (Wilson, 1982), and teeth of the mammal group Tillodontia (Russell, 1935). In addition, potassium-argon dating studies have provided comparable ages for the Allenby Formation: 48 ± 2 Ma (Rouse and Mathews, 1961; Mathews, 1964), between 47 ± 2 and 50 ± 2 Ma (Hills and Baadsgaard, 1967), and 46.2 ± 1.9 Ma and 49.4 ± 2 Ma (Read, 2000). With a different method (U-Pb age from zircons), Moss et al. (2005) suggested an age of 52.08 ± 0.12 Ma for the Allenby Formation. Finally, Smith and Stockey (2007) report a personal communication from H. Baadsgaard (University of Alberta, 1999) that supports an age of 48.7 Ma for the ash of Layer #22 of the Princeton Chert. Because the 7.5 m of the Princeton Chert sequence (incorporating the layer where the fossil was collected) may have accumulated in 15,000 years or less (Mustoe, 2011), this latter age is probably the closest to the real age of the fossil. However, in order to be conservative regarding the uncertainty of the age of this formation, and the fact that no uncertainty is associated with the latter age, Saururus tuckerae provides a safe minimum age of 44.3 Ma (the youngest age given by potassium-argon dating minus the associated error of 1.9 Ma).""",Massoni et al (2015),stem,Saururus,5 / phylogenetic analysis,5 / combined morphological and molecular analysis (total evidence or backbone),"Massoni et al 2015 (PE): ""A morphological parsimony analysis using 24 morphological characters modified from matrices of Tucker et al. (1993), Tucker and Douglas (1996), and Meng et al. (2003) placed Saururus tuckerae in a single most parsimonious position within the family Saururaceae, as the sister group of a clade formed by the two extant species of Saururus (Smith and Stockey, 2007). The relationship of the fossil with extant Saururus, one of four genera in Saururaceae, was supported by the following synapomorphies: basally connate carpels, 1-2 ovules per carpel, and marginal placentation (Smith and Stockey, 2007). This study indicated that the genus Saururus was sister to Gymnotheca, and Anemopsis was sister to Houttuynia, relationships supported by other molecular and morphological studies (Meng et al., 2002, 2003; Jaramillo et al., 2004; Neinhuis et al., 2005; Wanke et al., 2007b; Massoni et al., 2014). Outside the Saururaceae, the relationships are compatible with molecular studies (e.g., Qiu et al., 2005, 2006; Soltis et al., 1999, 2000a, 2000b, 2007, 2011; Mathews and Donoghue, 1999, 2000; Qiu et al., 1999, 2000; Doyle and Endress, 2000; Savolainen et al., 2000; Zanis et al., 2002, 2003; Borsch et al., 2003; Hilu et al., 2003; Kelly and González, 2003; Jaramillo et al., 2004; Wanke et al., 2007a, 2007b; Massoni et al., 2014). We thus consider Saururus tuckerae to provide a minimum age for the stem node of the extant genus Saururus, which is also the crown node of Gymnotheca + Saururus (Figure 1).""","stem Saururus (Saururaceae, Piperales), min 44.3 Ma",44.3 Ma,†Saururus tuckerae Smith & Stockey,"Massoni J, Doyle J, Sauquet H. 2015.

Ribs are arranged in a distinctive pattern in which two sets of ribs each radiate from a pair of divergence points. Main axes of the two sets of ribs are at an angle of 45–90° to each other.

Friis et al. (2004) consider that ""The most distinctive feature of this pollen is its inaperturate condition, the crossed pattern of narrow, straight ribs, and the easily detached ektexine that rest on a thin, inconspicuous 16 granualr endexine. Among Araceae, inaperturate, striate pollen occurs in two subfamilies: Monsteroideae and Aroideae. In Monsteroideae these features occur together in both genera of Spathiphylleae (Holochlamys, Spathiphyllum). The strongest resemblance between the fossil pollen and pollen of extant Araceae is with the two very closely related genera of Spathiphylleae: Spathiphyllum and Holochlamys. Both have inaperturate, striate pollen of medium size (mean size, 32 and 33 µm, respectively). The pollen wall consists mainly of acetolysis-resistant ribs (formed from ektexine), a very thin, granular (Holochlamys) to weakly columellate (Spathiphyllum) infratectal layer, and a very thin granular endexine (Friis et al., 2004). Pollen of some species of Spathiphyllum has very fine ribs similar to the fossil, but in those species surveyed (Friis et al., 2004), the ribs run in only one direction extending between two distinct divergence points. In Holochlamys the same crossed pattern of ribs is present as in the fossil material. The ribs radiate from two pairs of more or less asymmetrically placed divergence points.” (Friis, et al., 2004).

The Princeton Chert consists of a series of alternating layers of coal and chert. The paleontological record supports a middle Eocene age, such as an amiid fish correlated with the occurrence of comparable fossils in British Columbia and in the Klondike Mountain Formation of Washington State (Wilson, 1982), and teeth of the mammal group Tillodontia (Russell, 1935). In addition, potassium-argon dating studies have provided comparable ages for the Allenby Formation: 48 ± 2 Ma (Rouse and Mathews, 1961; Mathews, 1964), between 47 ± 2 and 50 ± 2 Ma (Hills and Baadsgaard, 1967), and 46.2 ± 1.9 Ma and 49.4 ± 2 Ma (Read, 2000). With a different method (U-Pb age from zircons), Moss et al. (2005) suggested an age of 52.08 ± 0.12 Ma for the Allenby Formation. Finally, Smith and Stockey (2007) report a personal communication from H. Baadsgaard (University of Alberta, 1999) that supports an age of 48.7 Ma for the ash of Layer #22 of the Princeton Chert. Because the 7.5 m of the Princeton Chert sequence (incorporating the layer where the fossil was collected) may have accumulated in 15,000 years or less (Mustoe, 2011), this latter age is probably the closest to the real age of the fossil. However, in order to be conservative regarding the uncertainty of the age of this formation, and the fact that no uncertainty is associated with the latter age, Saururus tuckerae provides a safe minimum age of 44.3 Ma (the youngest age given by potassium-argon dating minus the associated error of 1.9 Ma).""",Magallón et al (2015),stem,Cyperaceae+Juncaceae,2 / intuitive or unspecified (trusted source),3 / molecular tree only,"Magallón et al 2015 (NewPhytol): ""The vegetative remains consist of stems with attached roots, lateral branches and sheathing leaves similar to those of Juncaceae or Cyperaceae.

(Leng & Friis, 2006). Dilcher et al. (2007) considered Synocarpus decussatus congeneric with Hyrcantha karatscheensis from western Kazakhstan, except that the Chinese species has larger carpels that contain more seeds. These authors described it as follows ""Plant erect, 20–25 cm tall, with predominately alternate branching of 30–45°, rarely ternate branching three to four times. Pedicels of the fruits, 1.5–2.7 cm long, ensheathed by an ocrea. Gynoecium superior with two to four oval-elongate carpels, in a decussate arrangement. Carpels have an 24 enlarged terminal mass that is filled with numerous resinous bodies. Two crests extend approximately one-eighth of the carpel length, as well as a well defined adaxial suture extending approximately one-half of the carpel length. Each carpel contains 10–16 ovules/seeds attached along the adaxial linear placentae. Ovules/ seeds may occur in pairs. Ovules/seeds oval to oblong, anatropous, slightly pointed hilar region and rounded to truncate antihilar region"" (Dilcher et al., 2007). Dilcher et al. (2007) indicated that several attributes of the fossil suggest it was an aquatic plant with emergent reproductive organs. Pollen has not been found in association with Sinocarpus decussatus/Hircantha decussata (Dilcher et al., 2007), therefore, unequivocal indication of its affinity with eudicots is unavailable. However, its combined morphological features suggest an affinity within eudicots, namely, the presence of inflorescences with decussate branching and the possibly tetramerous flower (Leng & Friis, 2003). The incomplete fusion of the carpels, the likely absence of a compitum, the superior ovary, the three or four carpels, and the possible long decurrent stigmatic region indicate that this fossil does not belong to the advanced eudicots, but rather represents a basal eudicot lineage (Leng & Friis, 2003). The leaves show distinct attributes that support a ""dicot"" affinity, namely, a distinct juncture between petiole and lamina, leaf venation of at least three discrete orders of veins forming a reticulate network, and the presence of glandular teeth with at least two orders of tooth venation (Hickey & Wolfe 1975; in Leng & Friis, 2006). Based on the morphological characters of the infructescence, particularly the superior and basally syncarpous gynoecium and the opposite-decussate phyllotaxis, and of the leaves, Leng & Friis (2003, 2006) considered this fossil as a basal eudicot or basal core eudicot, particularly resembling members of Ranunculaceae, Myrothamnaceae and Buxaceae. Dilcher et al. (2007) considered that, whereas the morphological attributres of Sinocarpus decussatus/Hircantha decussata are not found in any one species of Ranunculaceae, they correspond to various taxa over the entire family. Characteristics that are shared include paniculate inflorescences, unisexual flowers, few carpels (1–10) that are free to slightly connate, carpels with very short stalks, a stigma with two low crests extending down along the ventral suture, a well defined ventral suture extending down approximately one-half of the carpel length, and a placenta that is linear, lateral, and marginal (Dilcher et al., 2007). Sinocarpus decussatus/Hyrcantha decussata shows a number of features that relate it with Ranunculaceae, but also a combination that does not occur in this family (Dilcher et al., 2007). Leng & Friis (2003, 2006) found it resembles members of Ranunculaceae, Myrothmnaceae and Buxaceae, and considered it most likely represents a basal eudicot lineage. The morphological features of this fossil are found dispersed among members of eraly diverging eudicot lineages, hence, it might correspond to an eudicot crown group member. However, the possibility that it is an eudicot stem representative cannot be ruled out, especially because its pollen grains are unknown. Hence, Sinocarpus decussatus/Hyrcantha decussata is here used to calibrate the eudicot stem node.""","stem Eudicotyledoneae, min 125 Ma",125 Ma,"†Hyrcantha decussata (Leng et Friis) Dilcher, Sun, Ji et Li","Magallón S, Gómez-Acevedo S, Sánchez-Reyes LL, Hernández-Hernández T. 2015.

Thus, tricolpate pollen can be unequivocally related to the eudicot clade. The oldest fossil ocurrences of tricolpate pollen are in sediments closely corresponding to the Barremian-Aptian boundary. However, in slightly younger sediments, tricolpate pollen becomes more frequent, and undergoes a major diversification between the late Early Cretaceous and the onset of the Late Cretaceous. The single pollen grain from Barremian sediments in the Atherfield Wealden Bed 35 in the English succession is reported as being very small (16 ?m), with simple apertures and muri, and reticulate ornamentation (Hughes & McDougall, 1990). Its preservation is similar to that of other pollen grains in the same assemblage (Hughes & McDougall, 1990), thus suggesting it does not represent an instance of contamination. A different type of tricolpate pollen, represented also by a single grain, is reported from the middle of Fitton's Group IV, Ferruginous Sands of the Atherfield succession, corresponding to the Aptian (Hughes & McDougall, 1990). The tricolpate pollen grains from the Cocobeach sequence in Gabon have a reticulate-columellate pollen wall. Grains referred to as aff. Tricolpites micromurus are reported as being small, about 16 µm long and 12 µm in diameter; and those referred to as aff. Tricolpites crassimurus as being larger, about 30 µm in diameter. Tricolpate-reticulate pollen becomes more diverse in Aptian sediments of the Cocobeach sequence, and includes grain referred to as to ‘Retitricolpites’ geranioides, cf. Tricolpites georgensis and Tricolpites sp. 2 (Doyle et al., 1977, cited in Friis et al., 2011, also cited in Doyle & Hotton, 1991). ‘Retitricolpites’ geranioides is about 50 µm long, and represents the largest of the tricolpate grains in this sequence. Tricolpate-striate pollen is reported from the early part of Pollen Zone VIII (Early Aptian) of the Cocobeach sequence (Doyle, 1999). Tricolpate pollen most likely evolved on the stem lineage of eudicots. The oldest fossil tricolpate pollen grains lack any distinctive features to link them to a particular living group within eudicots, and very possibly represent stem lineage relatives of eudicots as a whole.

Each of these separate floral parts is very similar to those of Spanomera mauldiniensis Drinnan, Crane, Friis & Pedersen, known from the younger Mauldin Mountain locality, Elk Neck Beds, Potomac Group, Maryland, USA, from palynological Zone III of the Potomac succession, corresponding to the early Cenomanian (Drinnan et al., 1991). The genus Spanomera consists of inflorescences with staminate and pistillate flowers, all with a clear opposite-decussate organization. Staminate flowers have (2+2) or (2+3) tepals and stamens. The anthers have thecae that are ventrally displaced, and dehiscence is through a slit. Pistillate flowers are bicarpellate. Each carpel is semicircular in outline, with a decurrent stigma along most of the curved ventral margin (Drinnan et al., 1991). Both species of Spanomera are very similar and differ mostly in size and in the number of parts in the staminate flowers. Pollen similar to that produced by Spanomera marylandensis is common in many Potomac Group samples and has been referred to the dispersed pollen species Striatopollis vermimurus (Brenner) Srivastava, which is tricolpate, prolate, with clearly delimited colpi that extend approximately 2/3 of the grain, with semitectate, with widely spaced muri that result in a coarse striate-rugulate to reticulate-rugulate structure (Drinnan et al., 1991). Drinnan et al. (1991) considered that the morphological and structural features of Spanomera suggest a relationship with Buxaceae, especially the opposite and decussate organization of inflorescences and flowers, and the presence of a well-developed pistillode in the center of staminate flowers. Doyle & Endress (2010) included Spanomera in a morphology-based phylogenetic analysis, where its most parsimonious position was as sister to Buxaceae. In this analysis, Didymeles, the sister taxon to other Buxales was not included. On the basis of specialized features of the pollen present in Didymeles and in Buxaceae, and on the simple apertures in the pollen of Spanomera, it is thought that the fossil genus diverged before the split of Didymeles (Doyle & Endress, 2010), and thus is a stem representative of Buxales.

Three lines of evidence support this conclusion. First, the leaf lamina shows strong tendencies toward orbicular shape, the point of petiole attachment is displaced towards the center of the leaf, and the petiole attaches to the blade at a high angle. Second, the primary venation shows strong radial organization, the primary and secondary veins bifurcate well within the margin, several series of excostal loops are developed within the margin. Third, growth habit is laminar shape in the vertical dimension."". A second type of leaves, of smaller size, referred to as Nelumbites cf. N. minimus Vakhrameev was also recorded from the Quantico locality (Upchurch et al., 1994). Reproductive remains similar to those of extant Nelumbo also occur in the Quantico locality, strengthening the relationship with this living taxon. These include ""laminar units with similarities in venation, shape, and preservational features to tepals and axial structures with similarities to Nelumbo floral receptacles at fruiting stage. The venation in the fossil tepals is similar to that in tepals of extant Nelumbo but less complex, perhaps due to their smaller size. Additional reproductive structures comprise three impressions that preserve features suggestive of a floral axis. The structures preserved may be readily interpreted in terms of the characteristic morphology of fruiting receptacles of Nelumbo."" (Upchurch et al., 1994).

In both Joffrea and Cercidiphyllum the pistillate inflorescence is produced from an axillary bud, but the mode of short shoot growth and leaf production is very different. The arrengement of long shoot leaves in Joffrea is unknown, but the opposite leaves of short shoots and seedlings are comparable with the opposite to subopposite leaf arrangement seen in long shoots of Cercidiphyllum. Externally the long shoots of Joffrea had distinct circular lenticels similar to those of extant Cercidiphyllum.

There are also similarities in the seeds, which are “winged and have a raphe which extends into the wing before turning abruptlyand entering the chalaza of the seed body, but differ considerabñy in other features. Those of Joffrea vary in the form of the wing but are generally crescent shaped and always have the seed body positioned 60 proximally and towards the convex margin. Seeds of Cercidiphyllum are more angular and rarely crescent shaped, and the position of the seed body varies considerably. Frequently the seed body is placed centrally within the wing.

They share a reduced perianth composed of four carpels with one anatropous, pendulous ovule per carpel and an inferior ovary. Further similarities between Tarahumara sophiae and Haloragaceae are seen in fruitlet anatomy. Fossil flowers and fruits of Tarahumara sophiae are similar to those of the Tribe Myriophylleae (Meziella and Myriophyllum, the two genera of this tribe) where the ovary is differentiated into four separated carpels (Orchard & Keighery, 1993). In Meziella the carpels are surrounded by persistent, long sepals that are fused to form a terminal corona (Orchard & Keighery, 1993). The presence of this structure in Meziella resembles the floral cup of Tarahumara sophiae, which surrounds the four-apocarpic-syncarpic carpels” (Hernández-Castillo & Cevallos-Ferriz, 1999). When comparing this fossil with extant genera, Hernández-Castillo & Cevallos-Ferriz (1999) considered that “From the third verticil on, Tarahumara sophiae has a terminal simple dichasia with opposite branches resembling those of extant Haloragodendron. The inflorescence of Haloragodendron is a simple determinate dichasium. A dichasium, and more often the compound dichasium, is the basic unit of the indeterminate inflorescences/infructescences in Haloragaceae (Orchard, 1975). However, it is important to remark that the first two nodes have 63 verticillate axile flowers, resembling the position of the flowers of almost all extant species of Myriophyllum.” The stems assigned to Obispocaulis myriophylloides have “epidermis composed of semi-obloid cells with thin cuticle. The stems can be found isolated, or in groups of two or three, and are surrounded by ensheathing leaves. The presence of more than one stem in certain zones of these axes where stems ramify resembles the condition in the nodes of extant genera in the Haloragaceae. The anatomy of this fossil stems is very characteristic and similar of those of submerged stems of the genus Myriophyllum. The fossil stems are characterized by having an epidermis, a single circle of large lacunae separated by radially arranged chains of parenchyma cells connecting the inner and outer cortex, a welldeveloped endodermis, and a nonlacunate central stele with tracheids and some vessels. Among aquatic or subaquatic plants there are some genera with similar aerenchyma in their stems, but their architecture is quite different from that observed in Obispocaulis myriophylloides” (Hernández-Castillo & Cevallos-Ferriz, 1999). Hernández-Castillo & Cevallos-Ferriz (1999) considered that the plant represented by Tarahumara sophiae plus Obispocaulis myriophylloides “represents an extinct taxon with a mosaic of characters that can be found today in two or three extant genera (Myriophyllum, Meziella, and Haloragodendron) of the Haloragaceae. Documenting this situation is important since the history of the family based on the fossil record alludes to the presence of fruits and pollen grains that have been referred to extant taxa. The new fossil plant (T. sophiae + O. myriophylloides) broadens the morphology of reproductive and vegetative structures among Haloragaceae.” We consider that the fossil plant was a stem representative of Haloragaceae, and use it to calibrate the stem node of this family.","stem Haloragaceae (Saxifragales), min 72.1 Ma",72.1 Ma,†Tarahumara sophiae Hernández-Castillo & Cevallos-Ferriz,"Magallón S, Gómez-Acevedo S, Sánchez-Reyes LL, Hernández-Hernández T. 2015.

In Eucalyptus, however, £owers are bisexual, with a few exceptions (e.g. Carr et al., 1971), and the buds consist of a cup-shaped hypanthium which is covered by one or two caducous cap-like opercula (House, 1997). The gynoecium is inferior and enclosed by the cup-shaped hypanthium. The stamens are arranged in whorls and borne on a staminal ring on the apical margin of the £oral cup (e.g. House, 1997). The elongated style protrudes in the centre of the androecium. Since the operculum in Eucalyptus is derived from fusion of the tetramerous calyx or corolla (Williams and Brookner, 1997), it seems unlikely that it is homologous with the cap-like apical structure in the fossil £owers, which have three style- or stigma-lobes in a central position. Furthermore, there are no indications of stamens below the cap-like structure. Within the Myrtaceae, however, unisexual £owers with extremely short stigmas occur in the genus Psiloxylon.

The Princeton Chert consists of a series of alternating layers of coal and chert. The paleontological record supports a middle Eocene age, such as an amiid fish correlated with the occurrence of comparable fossils in British Columbia and in the Klondike Mountain Formation of Washington State (Wilson, 1982), and teeth of the mammal group Tillodontia (Russell, 1935). In addition, potassium-argon dating studies have provided comparable ages for the Allenby Formation: 48 ± 2 Ma (Rouse and Mathews, 1961; Mathews, 1964), between 47 ± 2 and 50 ± 2 Ma (Hills and Baadsgaard, 1967), and 46.2 ± 1.9 Ma and 49.4 ± 2 Ma (Read, 2000). With a different method (U-Pb age from zircons), Moss et al. (2005) suggested an age of 52.08 ± 0.12 Ma for the Allenby Formation. Finally, Smith and Stockey (2007) report a personal communication from H. Baadsgaard (University of Alberta, 1999) that supports an age of 48.7 Ma for the ash of Layer #22 of the Princeton Chert. Because the 7.5 m of the Princeton Chert sequence (incorporating the layer where the fossil was collected) may have accumulated in 15,000 years or less (Mustoe, 2011), this latter age is probably the closest to the real age of the fossil. However, in order to be conservative regarding the uncertainty of the age of this formation, and the fact that no uncertainty is associated with the latter age, Saururus tuckerae provides a safe minimum age of 44.3 Ma (the youngest age given by potassium-argon dating minus the associated error of 1.9 Ma).""",Pigg et al (1993),crown,Myrtoideae,2 / intuitive or unspecified (trusted source),3 / molecular tree only,"Pigg et al 1993 (CanJBot): ""Affinities of these fruits are with the berrylike guavas of the Myrtaceae, tribe Myrteae, subtribe Myrtinae, and in particular, with the closely related genera Mosiera Small and Psidium L.""","crown Myrtoideae (Myrtaceae, Myrtales), min 44.3 Ma",44.3 Ma,"†Paleomyrtinaea princetonensis Pigg, Stockey & Maxwell","Pigg KB, Stockey RA, Maxwell SL. 1993.

Floristic similarities among these sites are interpreted to indicate that they are approximately contemporaneous, so that all of these sources of vitaceous seeds are most likely late Maastrichtian, approximately 66 million years old.

This unit was first studied palynologically by Groot et al. (1961), who considered it Turonian based on preliminary studies on European sequences, and subsequently by Doyle (1969b), Wolfe and Pakiser (1971), Doyle and Robbins (1977), and Christopher (1979). Building on the palynological zonation of the Potomac Group by Brenner (1963), to which Doyle (1969a) added Zone III (uppermost Potomac) and Zone IV (lower Raritan), Sirkin (1974) assigned South Amboy palynofloras to a new Zone V. This unit was renamed the Complexiopollis exigua - Santalacites minor Zone by Christopher (1979) and redefined by Christopher et al. (1999) as the lowest of three subzones of the Sohlipollis Taxon Range Zone. Wolfe and Pakiser (1971) and Sirkin (1974) considered the South Amboy late Cenomanian, not much younger than underlying Woodbridge Clay Member (Zone IV), but Doyle (1969b) and Doyle and Robbins (1977) argued that it is no older than middle Turonian, based on the presence of Normapolles genera that appear at that level in Europe (Góczán et al., 1967). Doyle and Robbins (1977) and Christopher (1979) allowed that it was “possibly Coniacian,” but Crepet and Nixon (1994) and Crepet et al. (2005) accepted a late Turonian age. By contrast, Clarke et al. (2011) suggested a minimum age of the Santonian-Campanian boundary, 82.8 Ma. However, correlations by Christopher et al. (1999) and Christopher and Prowell (2010) with better-dated rocks in South Carolina imply that the Crossman locality is not this young; they correlate the C. exigua - S. minor Zone with calcareous nannofossil zones CC13 and CC14, which extend from late Turonian through Coniacian (Burnett, 1998; Ogg and Hinnov, 2012). We therefore believe there is enough evidence to consider that Jerseyanthus was at least of Coniacian age, which translates into a conservative minimum age of 85.8 Ma, the Coniacian-Santonian boundary (86.3 ±0.5 Ma; Ogg and Hinnov, 2012).""",Magallón et al (2015),stem,Brassicales,5 / phylogenetic analysis,4 / morphological and molecular trees compared,"Magallón et al (2015) state: ""The flowers of Dressiantha bicarpellata “exhibit a unique combination of characters relative to extant taxa, including the presence of a gynophore, 2 + 2 arrangementof the sepals, unequal petals, monothecal anthers, and a bicarpellate gynoecium” (Gandolfo et al., 1998). Gandolfo et al. (1998) noted that, among extant angiosperms, this character combination only occurs among the traditional Capparales, namely, with hypogynous, bisexual flowers, sepals commonly opposite and decussate, petals with imbricate, convolute, or valvate aestivation, between two and 12 stamens, tricolporate pollen grains, and in several taxa an ovary borne on a short gynophore. Gandolfo et al. (1998) noted thatthe gynoecia of Dressiantha and Brassicaceae are bicarpellate and the ovaries are bilocular, and pollen grains are tricolporate, and globose to prolate. We consider that Dressiantha could be a stem representative or crown member of Brassicales, and use it to calibrate the stem node of this order."" Furthermore, it should be noted that the original authors conducted a phylogenetic analysis based on morphological data that suggested a position well nested in Brasssicales, but relationships among extant families in their tree, and rooting of the order, are so different from current understanding based on molecular data that a stem node rather than crown node assignment is warranted for now, until further phylogenetic investigation has been conducted.","stem Brassicales, min 86.3 Ma",86.3 Ma,"†Dressiantha bicarpellata Gandolfo, Nixon and Crepet","Magallón S, Gómez-Acevedo S, Sánchez-Reyes LL, Hernández-Hernández T. 2015.

Among the wood features that relate C. terrazasiae with both families are the presence of indistinct growth rings, septate and/or nonseptate fi bers, alternate intervessel pits and vessel-ray parenchyma pits with reduced borders, simple perforation plates, scanty paratracheal, vasicentric and apotracheal diffuse axial parenchyma, and heterocellular rays. Molecular and morphological/ anatomical analyses (Terrazas, 1994, 1999; Martínez- Millán, 2000, 2003; APG II, 2003) support common ancestry of these two families. There is no single wood anatomical character separating these two families. Presence of both nonseptate and septate fi bers occurs in some members of the Anacardiaceae tribes Rhoeae (e.g., Loxostylis , Mauria, and Smodingium) and Anacardieae (e.g., Androtium , Buchanania) and Dobineae (Dobinea . Relationship of C. terrazasiae with members of the tribes Semecarpeae and Spondiadeae is precluded by the presence of exclusively nonseptate and exclusively septate fi bers respectively (Terrazas, 1994). Rays in Anacardiaceae are heterogeneous type IIA and IIB (Terrazas, 1994), though type III are present in some species of Anacardium and if homogeneous rays are present these are of the type I; Coahuiloxylon has heterogeneous type IIA rays, and occasional uniseriate rays. Androtium and Buchanania of the Anacardieae have heterogeneous rays type IIA (Terrazas, 1994), but in contrast to Coahuiloxylon only paratracheal parenchyma is present. Some genera in the Rhoeae (Loxostylis , Mauria, Smodingium) resemble Coahuiloxylon in having both paratracheal (scanty to vasicentric) and apotracheal (diffuse) parenchyma. However, only Mauria has type IIA rays. While radial canals are present in ca. 60% of the family (Terrazas, 1994), these are absent in Coahuiloxylon , a character shared with Mauria. Coahuiloxylon and Mauria share other important diagnostic features within Anacardiaceae such as presence of both nonseptate and septate fi bers, paratracheal and apotracheal parenchyma, and heterogeneous type IIA rays, but the particular mosaic of characters in C. terrazasiae precludes its inclusion in an extant taxon.""","stem Anacardiaceae (Sapindales), min 72.1 Ma",72.1 Ma,"†Coahuiloxylon terrazasiae Estrada-Ruiz, Martínez-Vabrera & Cevallos-Ferriz","Estrada-Ruiz E, Martínez-Cabrera HI, Cevallos-Ferriz SRS. 2010.

The fruits are described as “2.5–3.6 cm long (x= 3.0 cm, n= 16) with a central ovoid nut 0.6–1.25 cm long (x= 0.9 cm, n= 26), 0.35–0.8 cm wide (x= 0.6 cm, n= 26), and 0.25–0.3 cm thick attached to a broad wing with a small secondary wing on its upper surface. The wing is vascularized by several veins running parallel to its long axis at the top and others in the main body of the wing arching downward and outward, with a few interreticulations occurring between the major veins. The nut contains a single, large locule with two well-developed seeds, each with a seed coat that has a prominent palisade layer like that of many extant genera of Polygalaceae.” (Pigg et al., 2008). Pigg et al. (2008) found greater similarities between the fossil samara and those of extant Securidaca considering “(1) a lack of a broad attachment surface that would be expected in schizocarpic samaras; (2) the presence of a peduncle; (3) the presence of a wing with parallel venation apically that curves downward and outward in the body of the wing, with occasional interreticulations; (4) a proximal locule position with respect to the wing; and (5) presence of a small wing on the upper surface of the nut.” Furthermore, anatomical details of the fossil samara indicate an affinity with Polygalaceae, including “a spongy mesocarp and a prominent palisade layer of the outer seed coat.” (Pigg et al., 2008). Some attributes of Paleosecuridaca are more similar to those of other genera of Polygalaceae, and in one feature, the presence of two seeds of unequal size in a single locus, it differs from extant members of this family (Pigg et al., 2008).

The pollen of Caryanthus, and some aspects of its floral structure, are very similar to extant Rhoiptelea (Rhoipteleaceae). However, a different ovary position (superior in Rhoiptelea, inferior in Caryanthus) is an important difference between the two (Sims et al., 1999). Friis (1983) considered that Caryanthus shared features with Juglandaceae, specifically with the extant Pterocarya, or with Rhoiptelea in some aspects of floral structure. We here consider that among core Fagales, Caryanthus was more closely related to Rhoipteleaceae, Myricaceae and Juglandaceae, and use the Caryanthus fossils from the Allon locality to calibrate the stem node of the clade that includes these three families.

More than 80 diferent Normapolles genera have been recognized (Friis et al., 2003). Stratigraphically, Normapolles occur in the pollen spectrum as traces only in the middle and upper Cenomanian (Pacltová, 1971, 1977, 1978; in Pacltová 1981), but in the Turonian they are represented in the spectrum of marine sediments in frequencies that vary from 3 to 6 % depending on facies. The first representatives of this morphological group display a simple structure of pores; but during a short interval they become more complicated. Such are the first representatives of the first Normapolles specimens discovered in the Peruc Formation (Pacltová, 1977). They persisted until the early Eocene (Góczán et al., 1967), and had their maximal abundance, diversity and geographical distribution during the Santonian-Campanian. During the late 80 Cretaceous, they constituted a floristic realm termed the Normapolles province, which occupied western Siberia, Europe and North America. Based exclusively on the morphology of the dipersed polen grains, establishing the systematic affinity of Normapolles was uncertain, but relationships with Fagales were proposed (e.g. Góczán et al., 1967; Skarby, 1968; Wolfe, 1973; in Friis et al., 2006). The fagalean affinity of Normapolles became very strongly supported by the finding of different types of flowers, from at least three Late Cretaceous localities, with in situ Normapolles pollen grains. These flowers have been assigned to six different genera from three geographical regions, i.e., Manningia and Antiquocarya from the Åsen locality in Scania, Sweden (Friis, 1983); Caryanthus also from Åsen, and from the Allon locality in Georgia, USA (Friis, 1983; Sims et al., 1999); Bedellia, from Allon (Sims et al., 1999); and Normanthus and Endressianthus, from localities in the Beira region in Portugal (Schönenberger et al., 2001; Friis et al., 2003). More specifically, the flowers with in situ Normapolles pollen show similarities with Juglandaceae/Myricaceae (i.e., Manningia, Antiquocarya and Caryanthus; Friis 1983; Sims et al., 1999), or with Betulaceae (Bedellia, Normanthus and Endressianthus; Sims et al., 1999; Schönenberger et al., 2001; Friis et al., 2003). Flowers and polen of Fagaceae and Nothofagaceae (and of the fossils Protofagaceae allonensis, Antiquacupula sulcata and Archaefagaceae futabensis) are structurally different from those in core Fagales. On the basis of their general inflorescence structure, floral organisation, and pollen features Friis et al. (2006) considered that the Normapolles complex comprises a heterogeneous, non-monophyletic group of plants representing different fagalean lineages within or close to the clade comprising extant Betulaceae, Casuarinaceae, Ticodendraceae, Myricaceae, Rhoipteleaceae and Juglandaceae (core Fagales). Based on inflorescence, flower and pollen character distribution, Normapolles pollen could have evolved independently in different lineages of core Fagales, or on the branch subtending this clade.

(1961), who considered it Turonian based on preliminary studies on European sequences, and subsequently by Doyle (1969b), Wolfe and Pakiser (1971), Doyle and Robbins (1977), and Christopher (1979). Building on the palynological zonation of the Potomac Group by Brenner (1963), to which Doyle (1969a) added Zone III (uppermost Potomac) and Zone IV (lower Raritan), Sirkin (1974) assigned South Amboy palynofloras to a new Zone V. This unit was renamed the Complexiopollis exigua - Santalacites minor Zone by Christopher (1979) and redefined by Christopher et al. (1999) as the lowest of three subzones of the Sohlipollis Taxon Range Zone. Wolfe and Pakiser (1971) and Sirkin (1974) considered the South Amboy late Cenomanian, not much younger than underlying Woodbridge Clay Member (Zone IV), but Doyle (1969b) and Doyle and Robbins (1977) argued that it is no older than middle Turonian, based on the presence of Normapolles genera that appear at that level in Europe (Góczán et al., 1967). Doyle and Robbins (1977) and Christopher (1979) allowed that it was “possibly Coniacian,” but Crepet and Nixon (1994) and Crepet et al. (2005) accepted a late Turonian age. By contrast, Clarke et al. (2011) suggested a minimum age of the Santonian-Campanian boundary, 82.8 Ma. However, correlations by Christopher et al. (1999) and Christopher and Prowell (2010) with better-dated rocks in South Carolina imply that the Crossman locality is not this young; they correlate the C. exigua - S. minor Zone with calcareous nannofossil zones CC13 and CC14, which extend from late Turonian through Coniacian (Burnett, 1998; Ogg and Hinnov, 2012). We therefore believe there is enough evidence to consider that Jerseyanthus was at least of Coniacian age, which translates into a conservative minimum age of 85.8 Ma, the Coniacian-Santonian boundary (86.3 ±0.5 Ma; Ogg and Hinnov, 2012).""",Ruhfel et al (2013),stem,Clusiaceae,5 / phylogenetic analysis,5 / combined morphological and molecular analysis (total evidence or backbone),"Ruhfel et al 2013 (IJPS): ""The extinct Paleoclusia was placed as a member of stem group Clusiaceae s.s. or within crown group Clusiaceae s.s. as sister to one of its two major subclades.""","stem Clusiaceae (Malpighiales), min 86.3 Ma",86.3 Ma,†Paleoclusia chevalieri Crepet & Nixon,"Ruhfel BR, Stevens PF, Davis CC. 2013.

Furthermore, fossil pollen fits well within the subfamily Euphorbioideae (pollen of the Euphorbioideae is tricolporate, often marginate, with a reticulate, more often per-forate tectum; Webster, 1975) and within the ""Hippomaneae configuration"" and ""Hippomaneae type"" of Punt (i.e., tricolporate, circular to three-lobed in polar view, pore short or narrow and elongate, colpi narrow often with a margo, tectate with distinct columellae). More detailed comparisons at the generic level emphasize the similarities between the inflorescences of the Hippomaneae and the fossil inflorescence."" All of the major features of the fossil inflorescences are shared by the inflorescences of one or more genera of the Hippomaneae (Crepet & Daghlian, 1982). These authors find noteworthy that inflorescences of such a modern aspect existed in the Middle Eocene, as Hippomaneae is derived within Euphorbiaceae.""

However, these authors found greater support for an affinity with Cunoniaceae, given the structure of the gynoecium (inferior and completely united at the overy level in Ansiophylleaceae); the numer of ovules per carpel (only one in Ansiphylleaceae); and the presence of involute placentas (apparently absent in Anisophylleaceae).

The gross morphology of genera such 102 M. Millan, W. Crepet as Colubrina, Scutia or Ziziphus (Fig. 4g–i) is very similar to that of S. pusillus. The pollen morphology of the fossil is also consistent with Rhamnaceae: tricolporate pollen with rugulate to striate-rugulate exine is present in Ziziphus (Nasri-Ayachi & Nabli, 1995), Paliurus (Schirarend, 1996), Hovenia (Zhang & Chen, 1992), and Sageretia (Perveen & Qaiser, 2005); but not in Rhamnus, Frungula (Punt et al., 2003), or Colubrina (Zhang & Chen, 1992). The phylogenetic analysis conducted in this study yielded two trees, one with S. pusillus as sister to Condalia and as sister to Krugiodendron in the other, well nested in Tribe Rhamneae (Fig. 9). However S. pusillus has a few characters that distinguish it from its putative closer relatives, for example its pubescence, a character not present in Krugiodendron or in Condalia (Medan et al., 2004). Pubescence is not a common feature among Rhamnaceae but it can be found in other genera such as Adolphia, Discaria, Kentrorhamnus, Retanilla, or Trevoa (Medan & Aagesen, 1995). Only with more detailed studies, can the position of S. pusillus within the Rhamnaceae be more confidently established. However, the recognition of S. pusillus as a member of the Rhamnaceae is a significant step towards a better understanding of the fossil history of that family. The abundance of specimens of this taxon (Table 3), the good degree of preservation and the previous observations made on this taxon (i.e. Crepet, 1974, 1979, 1984) allow for a more thorough study of the biology of this taxon, study that will be presented in a separate paper.

For example, P. octandra L. has 7 – 8 seeds per berry, though eight is relatively usual. In contrast, C. phytolaccoides always had six seeds per berry, with no variation among the more than 130 infructescences studied. Further similarity is found in the seed coat surface, though deficiently preserved. While the seed coat of C. phytolaccoides is glabrous, it has striations similar to the ornamentations formed in Phytolacca when its seeds dry (Rohwer, 1993).” (Cevallos-Ferriz et al., 2008). Cevallos- Ferriz et al. (2008) conducted anatomical studies and described in detail the integumentary anatomy of the seeds. They found that in both extant Phytolacca and the fossil fruits, the 37 external zone of the outer integument is represented by a palisade of thick-walled cells. Another important characteristic of the seeds of Phytolaccaceae (and Caryophyllales) is the presence of a curved embryo (Kajale, 1954), and its presence allowed the comparison of the fossil material with the available literature on mature seeds of Phytolacca (Cevallos-Ferriz et al., 2008). Cevallos-Ferriz et al. (2008) detected some differences between Coahuilacarpon phytolaccoides and Phytolacca, for example, pendulous versus axilar placentation, respectively, but these authors considered that shared characters between them are more numerous and of greater significance. Cevallos-Ferriz et al. (2008) considered that the fossil berry is morphologically and anatomically similar to Caryophyllales, and in particularly to Phytolaccaceae, and that attributes of Coahuilacarpon phytolaccoides clearly support a relationship with particular species of Phytolacca. Based on the similarity at morphological and anatomical level between the fossil and Phytolaccaceae, and particular species of Phytolacca, we consodered it to be closely related to this genus. We would have used it to calibrate the crown node of Phytolaccaceae, but in our phylogenetic tree, as well as in independent analyses (Stevens, 2013), Phytolaccaceae is paraphyletic. In our tree, the two species assigned to Phytolaccaceae are respectively more closely related to Sarcobataceae and Nyctaginaceae. Thus, we used Coahuilacarpon phytolaccoides to calibrate the crown node of the least inclusive clade that includes the two species assigned to Phytolaccaceae.""","stem Phytolacca (Phytolaccaceae, Caryophyllales), min 72.1 Ma",72.1 Ma,†Coahuilacarpon phytolaccoides Cevallos-Ferriz et al.,"Magallón S, Gómez-Acevedo S, Sánchez-Reyes LL, Hernández-Hernández T. 2015.

A similar set of features are present in extant Pteropyrum and Rheum. In the survey of extant fruits, this type of very fine, fusiform-reticulate venation was observed in very few other families, including Dioscoreaceae and Nyctaginaceae. However, such venation, in combination with the deeply inset intramarginal vein, is known only in Polygonaceae.

The ovaries of Stewartia and Pentapetalum have a broad base and taper toward the styles in a teardrop shape, with the rest of the floral parts attached to the receptacle at the same level of the gynoecium.

Although the morphological attributes of the fossil flowers suggest an affinity mostly with Stewartia (Theaceae), and with members of the traditional Theales (Tenstroemiaceae and Pentaphylacaceae), the phylogenetic analyses indicate different relationships. In all analyses, Pentapetalum trifasciculandricus forms part of a ""basal"" polytomy that involves the major lineages of Ericales. Thus, there is a conflict between the position that we would have assigned to the fossil based only on morphological similarity (close to Theaceae- Pentaphyllacaceae), and that derived from the result of phylogenetic analyses.

We explored further the phylogenetic placement of T. lilliei type A within Asterales in a parsimonious framework by using a matrix of pollen morphological characters (Supporting Data, List of Characters and Character State Definitions Used to Compile a Matrix Used as Input in Parsimony Analyses Aimed at Placing the Fossil Taxa and Table S1) and a phylogenetic tree of Asterales as backbone constraint (Fig. 2). After conducting a sensitivity analysis (see SI Materials and Methods, Estimation of Divergence Times) we found one position suitable for calibration based on the single most-parsimonious tree (188 steps). This single most-parsimonious tree places T. lilliei type A within Dasyphyllum of the Barnadesioideae (Fig. 2), the earliest diverging subfamily of the Asteraceae; the fossil possesses most of the derived morphological character states of the Dasyphyllum pollen (Figs. 3 and 4 and Fig. S3 A, B, D, and E). We also explored other scenarios, assuming T. lilliei type A was either an extinct stem relative of Asteraceae or more closely related to other members of the Asterales (Fig. S5 and Table S2).

S1) support the fossils’ affinity with Physalinae and Physalis. The newly identified species is placed in Physalinae with strong support in both MP and ML analyses and at a basal polytomy of (MP, weak support) or within (ML, strong support) the crown of core Physalis. Both the MP and ML topologies are generally consistent with and reproduced most major clades from (10), with robust support of the critical Physalinae clade. However, each tree recovered the closely related (10) Iochrominae and Deprea as collapsed into a single clade that also included Nicandra, which has Deprea-like calyx morphology but is not closely related to that genus. Nevertheless, the overall agreement of the MP and ML tree topologies with (10) is notable in light of the limitations of the analysis. Notably, no species fromoutside Physalinae were misplaced among Physalinae, and no Physalinae species were misplaced into other clades. Considering the unknown additional organs of this extinct species, the incomplete knowledge of calyx morphology in extant Solanaceae, and problematic resolution among extant basal species of Physalinae (13, 25), we suggest that the newly identified species can be used, conservatively, to constrain the divergence of Physalinae to a minimum of 52.2 Ma."" Here, we more conservatively use this fossil to constrain the crown node of Solanaceae.","crown Solanaceae (Solanales), min 52.22 Ma",52.22 Ma,"†Physalis infinemundi Wilf, Carvalho, Gandolfo, Cúneo","Wilf P, Carvalho MR, Gandolfo MA, Cu´neo NRC. 2017.
